I'm a software engineer with a degree in computer and communications engineering .

Besides programming , I've worked as a production assistant and editor on several projects with media companies , a hobby that turned into a job .

I've been working with several languages , mainly Ruby , JS and Python . I'm always dipping my toes and then jumping into the pool of new technologies , frameworks or ideas . Love to explore whatever's new and learn more .

Also Proud and disappointed supporter of Arsenal FC <a href>#WengerOut</a> .

Feel free to say hello and send me a message !
